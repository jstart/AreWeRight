## Notes

Immigration

“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me: I lift my lamp beside the golden door.”

What would we as logical conservatives and Christians do/believe in regards to immigration?
Discuss -
Open Borders
Christian Love vs. Accountability
Illegal immigration
(Emily's addition) Context of the ban and it's constitutionality given our protection of religious freedoms.  As Christians do we have a duty to protect all those that are persecuted in any form?  Under our chosen form of government we call ourselves protectors of freedom but only for the preelected few. History repeats itself. This country runs in cycles in terms of immigration reform/bans and it's a constant battle between what we know is right and our predisposed fears en masse.
