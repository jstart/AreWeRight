## Notes

Global Warming & the Environment

Paris Agreement
-slater: the Paris agreement did not change the infrastructure that is creating global warming. It was just a big fat fine for us to fund rising war economies (think TPP)

Economic trends (solar, wind job growth, Elon)

Slater: It's infrastructure. Yes. Global warming is a problem (the most important problem) but if we're trying to solve it with gas taxes rather then uprooting the infrastructure then nothing will change

Erik: In the overall climate argument, why is the Right so emphatic that global warming is a hoax? What do they stand to gain or lose by pushing this argument? Riffing on Dan’s point, Why is “Pascal’s Wager” invalid for this instance? Why is “the left’s” attempt to “be green” inherently bad?
