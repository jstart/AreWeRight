## Notes

Gun Control

http://www.cc.com/shows/jordan-klepper-solves-guns

Reasons people are resistant to gun control legislation:
1. Constitution
Militia Clause
http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/55/militia-clause

The Second Amendment Guarantees the Right of Revolution?

2. Self-Defense
    - Rodney King Riots

Why now? What has increased gun violence, or is there just more awareness and fear?
1. Video Games/Media
    - Batman Shooting

Improvements we can push for today
- Mental Health/Background checks
- Gun Show loophole

Ongoing Challenges
- Weapons Smuggling (border issue?)

- Buy Backs? Search and Seizure in poor/dangerous neighborhoods? (Australia example)

Conclusion
We can’t un-invent automatic weapons, the same way we can’t forget how to make nuclear weapons.  Nuclear disarmament, logical sanctions, and diplomacy all work towards minimizing the risk of nuclear fallout.  Perhaps these are the same strategies that will be effective in curbing gun violence.

-might be fun to note that for the most part Canadians have similar gun laws to ours but maybe they don't cultivate a culture that invites gun violence.
-if someone wants to play the asshole you can have someone argue in favor of stronger restrictions for the 'types' of people who commit the most gun crimes.
-you can also include the mental health argument.
-NRA gains membership whenever people are afraid of gun restriction. The paradox of the media shouting for gun restriction or gun responsibility is that the NRA can use that to spin a paranoia narrative. So reasonable people who want background checks on people with mental help issues have to find a way to communicate the concern without beating the same old dead horse.
-black kids are getting shot in the streets by pigs. American citizens ought to be able to plug piggies if they are stepping over the law and getting away with it.
