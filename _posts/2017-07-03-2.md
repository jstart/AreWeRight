## Notes

ACA Obamacare - Problems, brief history, GOP campaigning against.

Healthcare is complicated and huge - Medicare, Medicaid, subsidies, women’s health, mental illness

Competition surpassed in Health Care (tied to employer, limited access, pre-existing conditions) There is no room for an Apple of Healthcare due to red-tape, regulations

Dan read the bill - “What is the AHCA?”
